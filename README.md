# Browser Support
KUTE.js is redeveloped for maximum performance on modern browsers. Some legacy browsers might some help, so give them a small polyfill set with most essential features required by KUTE.js to work, powered by [minifill](https://github.com/thednp/minifill), try it. For broader projects you might want to consider <a href="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/docs/">polyfills</a>.
